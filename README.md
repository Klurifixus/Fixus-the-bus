THE STORY OF FIXUS-THE-BUS AND WHY I DO THIS!

Welcome, this blog is about me getting the perfect life for our family. As we all wish for.
It goes into different steps where the first one is about educating to a work that will be abel to do as a digtal nomad. But under i will make the planned steps to make this life possible:
1. Getting a fullstack diploma
2. Study Bi-Analyst and AI (this will be done under the time i make everything else thats under this
)
3. Get a D-licens so I can drive a bus.
4. Get the bus, this model is only avaiable in germany,france,italy and poland. So i need to travel to import it directly. The model is a Mercedes Vario: 614d,814d or 815d.
5. Then i need to build it, it should have solarpanels, kitchen, bathroom with shower, smart solutions, place for for passengers. floor on the roof, wind turbine and much more.
6. Get a job as a digital nomad for me and my family so they will se as much around europe as I have when i grew up.

But as I said. It all starts here. Now I need to build a home page, getting knowleadge, and this is just one step on the stairway to freedom... again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps I´ve done on FIXUS-THE-BUS:

1.COPIED THE TRAVELERS README FILE AS A GUIDE FOR ME TO MAKE AND TO REMEMBER WHAT SHOULD BE INIT.
(This will be hard as it is to remember anyway)

2. Make the files: index.html (emmet "!" for getting the first codes for free ;), blogg.html, contact.html 

3. Fixed a header, main and footer in the body of index.html

4. Made the folder named assets, and inside that one 2 other folders: images and favicon. Also made and downloaded favicon icon (used font awesome to get the picture den made it in favicon) on a bus to put in index.html 

5. Added favicon links in index.html

6. Added meta text for search engines, inspired by the Love Running project but for the purpose of this site.

7. Created css folder with style.css file.

8. Import fonts from fonts.Google.com to style css.

9. Found pallette on colorhunt that i will use. Will be these so far(
#053B50 rgb(5, 59, 80)
#176B87 rgb(23, 107, 135)
#64CCC5 rgb(100, 204, 197)
#EEEEEE rgb(238, 238, 238)
10. Added stylesheet thru emmet in index.html, changed path thru href"

11. Added asterisk wildcard to style.css. it should be highest because it needs to over-rule all the other. 
12. Realized favicon did´nt work. So updated the href and now the path is right.
13. added general style and project style, relized i needed to change background color to the pallette i choosen.
14. Also made the footer to be pushed to bottom by guidence of love running. (didnt remember the settings fully) 
15. Put font-family in the body of css. right now montserrat and sanserif but that might change in the futur.
16. added logo and fontfamily in header.(both css and html)
17. create nav in header and href to the existing html files: index,contact and blogg.
18. styled header with influens from love running for now. will change the later on.
19.

Learning more about the specific locations where the services are offered, as well as the qualifications and experience of the caregivers

ensuring that the childcare services are safe, reliable, and trustworthy.

# Requirements
A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.

# Features

Exotic Daycare is a three page website wich contains:
A home page with a hero image and short but important information about what the site is all about.

# Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
Github/Gitpod

# Design 

As my first project it clearly reflects many parts that i have learned so for in the course, The footer is taken straight out of the love running project and many ideas are inspired from the practices.

My goal has been to make a playful and fun website with many colours yet matching and suiting designs.

Tiny Travellers is a website made of three pages wich all can be navigated to from the navigation bar in every page. The bar is a column in a round fun form.

![Tiny Travelers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118939854/228549568-2e293ddc-0ae4-4116-9e2e-b570cd27c171.png)

Images are all custom sized to fit the content and very suiting.

# Testing 

Test of functionality and appearance of the website has have been dealt with thru out all stages of the development phase.

Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.

Most of my problems has been to make the whole page responsive as parts of the page were left out of the screen or occupying the space of some other part.
The problems have been solved by using a long list of media queries for screens with a maximum with of 500px and for a maximum width of 767 px. 

A problem occured when the Logo expanded over the heading area but was solved by using media queries and decrease the padding.
The navigation had a very similar problem wich was solved in the same way.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
